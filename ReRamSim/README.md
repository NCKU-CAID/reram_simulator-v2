# ReRamSim

#### I take NeuroSim as refernece and write some cpp files that it requires to generate power, latenct, etc

#### But there are some files that I think it may not use or need to modify in our project
#### As a consequence, I haven't add the files below into our ReRamSim
1. Network.csv
2. param.cpp
3. param.h
4. SRAMWriteDriver.cpp
5. SRAMWriteDriver.h
6. SramNewSA.cpp
7. SramNewSA.h
8. makefile
9. temp.log
